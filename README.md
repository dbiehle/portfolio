Some of my featured projects, interests, and skills

## User Stories: MVP
*Let these user stories guide your development:*
* As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
* As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.
* As a developer, I want wireframes for each of the main views in my portfolio, so I will have a concrete idea of the design I am building.
* As a developer, I want to make a data model (object constructor) for my portfolio data, so I can store individual projects and render them to the DOM.

* As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
* As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I can find my stylings swiftly.

* As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
* As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
* As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.

## User Stories: Stretch Goals
* As a visitor, I want to see projects one per row on mobile, so that I can read the detail easily.

* As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest material on top so that I can easily see the developer's recent work.
* As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on such material to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.
